                <h2>About the Datahack</h2>
                <p>The primary function of this event is to bring together junior scholars from all levels
                    (undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral) who are interested in network science, know
                    the tools and methods, and want to solve problems and produce useful insights in a highly
                    collaborative and dynamic environment.</p>

                <p>Network science is the study of the structure and function of graphs, networks, and other
                    relational data. It involves the collection, management, analysis, interpretation, and
                    presentation of network data. The field of network science aims to develop new tools and
                    techniques to answer questions about interconnected data. Network data poses unique
                    analytic challenges, and network scientists leverage many data analysis methods to
                    answer questions about the interconnected world.  The purpose of the datahack is to
                    identify the superstars who have mastered those methods. Students in the fields of
                    network science, data science, and statistics at Yale are expected to have a strong
                    understanding of computational optimization and algorithm design. We want to invite them
                    (and others) to use these skills on new, real-world problems in need of real solutions.</p>

                <h2>Who will be there?</h2>
                <p>Our faculty are designing a screening procedure to identify participants with the
                    necessary skills in network and data science, and we expect a minimum of 50
                    participants from Yale and beyond.</p>
                <p>This event is structured around network science to focus on practical applications in
                    our field. To be successful, we need problems, data sets, and sponsorship. Why
                    should you participate? Access to talent. Our datahack will bring together trained
                    undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral students with backgrounds and skills in
                    network science and data science, all together in one room. With problems provided by
                    our sponsors, we plan to assemble 3-4 use cases in 3-4 industries as our event
                    challenge.</p>
